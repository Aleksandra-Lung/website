        <p className="two-columns">Alexandra Lung`s appearance on the fine arts scene and her solo exhibition in 2010, resulted from her long deposited energy. She had obviously charted her artistical personality much earlier with the fine arts generation of Novi Sad in the nineties. With the protagonists of this art scene she is still communicating. Many of them have been continually active during all these years. With her above mentioned exhibition she has indicated her future researching, art creating and ambitious projects. The art of painting of Alexandra Lung is geometric abstraction. She creates in cycles, that is, in the series of paintings, in which she develops one motive in many ways. Her technological treatment comprises simultaneous realizing of many paintings. Her conception itself is being arising during the work process. The space of the painting is in places cut by the acute surfaces of the resonant colourful contents. So, the expressive tone subliminal with the geometrical rhythm points out energy and decisiveness. Because of that, the title of that work series, The Spaces, has simply intruded itself on, and with it, the artist defines multifunctional meaning of the painting. It is aesthetic, and with it she defines the possibility of extending one idea (motive) presented in the space composition, where every painting surface is a local colour space, which mutually communicates with both color and form. When it is inspiring, then it presents the need to express her personal feelings harmoniously and to alterate with both shape and colour the visual identity of everyday life, what can be anticipated through the principle of the architectural rhythm. As well as symbolically, as a personal manifesto, the space where the artist will act, in the painting in which she is going to build her own style. There she is to find the adequate place for herself in the ambience of the modern visual art. In a continuation of these Spaces and somehow researching the abstract form domains, appear The Molecules 10 x10. They are compositions made of the units, the paintings of the size 10 x 10cm, which contain apart the elements of the work. Those compositions are the molecules of the painting organism. i.e. composition. They can be arranged in many ways and so transform the work according to the principle of various colourful configurations either according to the size of the painting, or according to its form. At some moments these molecules are fractals as even multiplicts, too, but on account of their specific features and various contents, they are anyway the facts of the complex organism. It is particularly significant that every composition can be endlessly continued in all directions according to the principle of (the artist?s and spectator?s) own aesthetic logic. In this way Alexandra has begun a dialogue with new spaces of painting. Painting is not an assumed two - dimensional formation, what has been concluded in many ways by the modern art. There is one more answer offered by this artist. Painting can equally convincingly function in space like sculpture and it can fill it and present, transform and shape it. Painting is not only a visual experience but also a palpable, material cognition. That painting is not only an object and a composition whole, but as well its integral parts (molecules) and elements (line, surface)are a new spatial experience. And, also, a painting is the scanned one?s own character, one and unique DNA structure. As well as the previous cycle these works are also combinations of lines and tightened surfaces of resonant colour. And yet while she promoted the idea of talking at length and multitude of geometrical and colour combinations in the former cycle, she now defines more precisely the problem she has been researching in her own way. In the same way as the previous works collection indicated this one, not suspecting Alexandra Lung?s artistic potentials, so, this collection will be one more introduction into her further researching and creations in the field of fine arts. Therefore, this painting, with these new ideas and particular expression, has extended the spaces of the abstract art. This artist is joining to her numerous colleagues which had been creating it in their experience, hundred years old. Radmila Savcic</p>
